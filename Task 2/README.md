To-Do List Web App
Project Overview
This repository contains a front-end To-Do List web application built using vanilla JavaScript as part of the Web Development Internship task. The app allows users to add tasks, mark them as complete by adding "(complete)" with a toggle class, and remove them dynamically without page reload.
Features

Add new tasks via an input field and "Add Task" button or Enter key.
Mark tasks as complete by checking the checkbox (appends "(complete)" and applies a completed style).
Remove tasks using a dedicated "Remove" button for each task.
Instant UI updates using DOM manipulation.

Technologies Used

HTML: Structure with input, add button, and list container.
CSS: Styling for clarity with gradients and transitions.
JavaScript (ES6): Logic for adding, completing, and removing tasks with event listeners.

Setup Instructions

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Open the project folder in VS Code.

How to Use

Click the "Remove" button next to a task to delete it.

Challenges Faced
