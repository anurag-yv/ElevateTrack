🌟 WEB DEVELOPMENT INTERNSHIP - TO-DO LIST APP 🌟

🚀 Project Overview
Welcome to my To-Do List Web App! This project, built as part of the Web Development Internship, is a dynamic front-end application using vanilla JavaScript. It lets you add tasks, mark them as complete with "(complete)" text, and remove them—all with instant UI updates!
🎯 Features

✨ Add new tasks using the input field and "Add Task" button or Enter key.
✅ Mark tasks as complete by checking the box (adds "(complete)" text).
🗑️ Remove tasks with a "Remove" button for each task.
⚡ Instant UI updates without page reloads.

🛠️ Technologies Used

HTML: Structured with input, add button, and list container.
CSS: Styled with gradients, animations, and a clean layout.
JavaScript (ES6): Powers adding, completing, and removing tasks with event listeners.

📋 Setup Instructions

Clone this repo to your local machine.
Open the folder in VS Code.
Run index.html using a live-server extension (e.g., Live Server).
Ensure all files (index.html, styles.css, script.js) are in the same directory.

🎮 How to Use

Type a task and hit "Add Task" or press Enter to add it.
Check the box to mark a task as complete (shows "(complete)").
Click "Remove" to delete a task.

💡 Challenges Faced

Customized the "complete" text toggle instead of line-through for clarity.
Designed a larger, beautiful layout with smooth animations.
